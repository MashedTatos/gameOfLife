# gameOfLife


Conways game of Life is a cellular automaton where each cell has a set of rules and based on these rules, the cells state can be determined. Its a great program for begginer programmers because it helps you understand concepts like classes and arrays while at a small scale and the logic behind it can be challenging. it can also be made in any language in any environment

there is 2 possible states: life or death.

The rules (taken from the wiki):
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
